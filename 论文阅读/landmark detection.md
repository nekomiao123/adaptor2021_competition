# Landmark detection

In general, they can be classified into 

- heatmap
- Coordinate regression
- Patch-based.  Landmark are close, so this method is difficult

### Heatmap-based 2D Landmark Detection with a Varying Number of Landmarks

heatmap-based neural network

a U-Net based architecture

output is a single foreground heatmap

use two separate networks to do this.

U-net and SCN
